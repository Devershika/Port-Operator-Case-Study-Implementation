# Port-Operator-Case-Study-Implementation
This project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be applied to real-world case studies. Specifically, it focuses on analyzing reports, policy documents, and stakeholder communications in the port and logistics industry to identify key stakeholders (using Named Entity Recognition) and assess stakeholder sentiment (using Sentiment Analysis).
The objective is to provide actionable insights to policymakers, port authorities, and manufacturers by automatically extracting and interpreting information from unstructured text corpora.

# Problem Understanding

Ports face challenges in handling large volumes of unstructured text such as reports, news articles, and government regulations.
* Key stakeholders like government bodies, competitor ports, and manufacturers need to be identified.
* Sentiment of these stakeholders toward certain policies/events needs to be tracked.
Manual processing is inefficient â†’ NLP automates this process.

# NLP Techniques Used
## 1. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
* Extracts stakeholders (e.g., Government of India, Mumbai Port Trust, Adani Logistics).
* Helps identify and classify entities into categories like Organizations, Locations, Competitors, Manufacturers.
## 2. Sentiment Analysis
* Evaluates stakeholder opinions from documents, social media, or press releases.
* Determines sentiment polarity: Positive, Negative, Neutral.
* Useful for assessing stakeholder reactions toward port developments, trade policies, or infrastructure expansion.


# Expected Outcomes
* Automated detection of stakeholders.
* Tracking sentiment shifts across time and events.
* Improved decision-making for policymakers and port authorities.
* Competitive benchmarking against rival ports.
